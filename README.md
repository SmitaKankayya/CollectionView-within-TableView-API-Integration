# CollectionView-within-TableView-API-Integration
This repository demonstrates how to integrate a collection view within a table view cell. The project fetches shopping cart data from a remote API, decodes it using JSONDecoder, and displays the data in a nested table view and collection view setup.<br><br>
Key features include custom table view and collection view cells, asynchronous image loading with Kingfisher, and clean, maintainable code organized using extensions.
